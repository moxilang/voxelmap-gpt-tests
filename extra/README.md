This folder is a testbed for procedural modeling powered by [VoxelMap](https://github.com/moxilang/voxelmap) and GPT-assisted code synthesis.

These experiments explore the generation of complex voxel structures via conversational input, scripted automation, and mesh rendering.  
All conversation management is powered by [`fur`](https://github.com/fur-labs/fur-cli) â€” a custom framework for contextual dialogue persistence and versioning.
