# Low Poly Spaceship

**andrew [ü¶ä]:** Full python script and MeshView for a massive low-poly sci-fi spaceship designed as a dense, compact structure rather than elongated. Its body is layered with jagged ridges, stacked plates, and interlocking geometric sections that suggest an almost architectural scale. At the center sits an encrusted, spherical-ish power core, partially embedded and surrounded by polygonal braces and glowing conduits that radiate outward. The hull bristles with asymmetrical modules: wing-like fins, antenna arrays, turret clusters, and lattice frameworks that jut out at odd angles. The surface is patterned with repeating ridges, vents, and extrusions, giving it the look of a city fused into a single massive craft. Neon strips of cyan, magenta, and yellow run along edges and seams, cutting through the darker metal-like forms. The silhouette is not streamlined ‚Äî it is chaotic, intricate, and fortress-like, as if it could be mistaken for a small mechanical planet or a fragmented Dyson construct.

Here‚Äôs a complete **Python script** using **VoxelMap** to generate a **low-poly sci-fi fortress-like spaceship** as described ‚Äî dense, ridged, encrusted with asymmetrical modules and conduits, and exported as a mesh with interactive visualization via `MeshView`.

### ‚úÖ Summary of What‚Äôs Included

* Dense central body with jagged, interlocking architecture
* Central encrusted power core (spherical-ish, semi-buried)
* Asymmetrical structures: fins, turrets, antennas
* Repeating surface patterns: ridges, extrusions
* Neon cyan, magenta, yellow highlights
* Exported as `.obj` using `MarchingMesh`
* Viewed interactively via `MeshView`

### üõ† Requirements

Ensure you've installed VoxelMap with mesh support:

```bash
pip install "voxelmap[mesh]"
```

---

### üñº Output

This will:

* Save a mesh as `spaceship.obj` with color info in `spaceship.mtl`
* Launch a **PyVista** window to explore the model in 3D

---

Let me know if you'd like:

* STL or PLY export
* GIF/PNG snapshot of the mesh
* Higher resolution or animation variants
* A Blender-ready optimized version

**andrew [ü¶ä]:** Make the powercore lime green and more massive, the only semi-transparent must be the dark metal plates which must be evenly spaced and cover the full powercore, everything else solid; components more complex in design. Also, add more color, and wireframe to lime green

## üß™ Tips

* Use `mode="both"` with `wireframe_color="lime"` to emphasize the **power core**
* You can change background with `background_image="stars.png"` if desired
* Exported files:

  * `spaceship.obj`
  * `spaceship.mtl`
